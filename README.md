# Manga Translator

An easy-to-use application for translating detected text in images from Japanese to English.

GUI was created using [Gio](https://gioui.org/). Gio supports a variety of platforms, including browsers,
but this application was designed to be used as a desktop application only.

> Note: this application should work on Windows, Linux, and macOS systems, but has only been tested on Windows.
