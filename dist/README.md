# Manga Translator Distribution Files

The files in the [cloudshell](./cloudshell) directory are for streamlining the process of creating the service account
and API keys needed to use manga-translator.

The files in the OS directories contain the files which are automatically included in the GitHub release for each
platform. These are mostly some short scripts for those who aren't familiar with terminals. Run them in the same
directory as the manga-translator binary.
