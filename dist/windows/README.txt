Coloured boxes will appear around all the text that was detected. Click on those boxes to display the original text and
the translation of that text.

You can click on the text in the "Original Text" or "Translated Text" sections to copy that text to your clipboard.

If you selected multiple images, you can navigate through them using the left and right arrow keys or the A and D keys.

Note: the clipboard translation option is very useful when used
in conjunction with the Windows snipping tool (Windows key + Shift + S)
